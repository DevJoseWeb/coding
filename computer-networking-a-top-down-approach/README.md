Solved some programming assignments of amazing Kurose & Ross Book.

2. **Chapter 2: Application Layer**
    - [Web Server](./cap2/1-web-server/server.py): In this assignment, you will develop a simple Web server in Python that is capable of processing only one request. Specifically, your Web server will (i) create a connection socket when contacted by a client (browser); (ii) receive the HTTP request from this connection; (iii) parse the request to determine the specific file being requested; (iv) get the requested file from the server’s file system; (v) create an HTTP response message consisting of the requested file preceded by header lines; and (vi) send the response over the TCP connection to the requesting browser. If a browser requests a file that is not present in your server, your server should return a “404 Not Found” error message.
    - [UDP Pinger](./cap2/2-udp-pinger/client.py): In this programming assignment, you will write a client ping program in Python. Your client will send a simple ping message to a server, receive a corresponding pong message back from the server, and determine the delay between when the client sent the ping message and received the pong message. This delay is called the Round Trip Time (RTT). The functionality provided by the client and server is similar to the functionality provided by standard ping program available in modern operating systems. However, standard ping programs use the Internet Control Mes- sage Protocol (ICMP) (which we will study in Chapter 4). Here we will create a nonstandard (but simple!) UDP-based ping program. Your ping program is to send 10 ping messages to the target server over UDP. For each message, your client is to determine and print the RTT when the correspon- ding pong message is returned. Because UDP is an unreliable protocol, a packet sent by the client or server may be lost. For this reason, the client cannot wait indefinitely for a reply to a ping message. You should have the client wait up to one second for a reply from the server; if no reply is received, the client should assume that the packet was lost and print a message accordingly.
    - [Multi-Threaded Web Proxy](./cap2/4-web-proxy/server.py): In this assignment, you will develop a Web proxy. When your proxy receives an HTTP request for an object from a browser, it generates a new HTTP request for the same object and sends it to the origin server. When the proxy receives the corresponding HTTP response with the object from the origin server, it creates a new HTTP response, including the object, and sends it to the client. This proxy will be multi-threaded, so that it will be able to handle multiple requests at the same time.
